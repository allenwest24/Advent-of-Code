# Here we go again!
This is my fourth year of advent of code and I want to take it on in the hardest language I've attempted yet, C! Because I am learning how to reverse engineer this year I would like to go throught eh challenges in the lowest-level language I know (besides Assembly). This should be pretty difficult because I haven't used C in over 2 years. In past years I have used Python, C++, and Go (in that order) with an off-season attempt of the 2018 year in Rust. C will be a whole new beast and I'm excited for it. My friend Tom will be joining me this year and is going to be doing it in Python. How fun.
